`server.js` Utilizes Express and EJS to host a webserver and serve up an API

`reqs.json` Holds all of the requirements a user must make (served up as API)

`package.json` && `package-lock.json` Just for installing packages (@Express and @EJS)

`/views/index.html` The webpage served up by express and EJS. EJS looks for a `/views` folder to serve up content by default

`/static/index.css` && `/static/index.js` The express server hosts the entire static folder at the route `weburl.com/static/`, static folders typically hold non-changing content (browser javascript, css, or images)

`/node_modules` is a hefty directory. If you're installing packages manually ignore this, it contains all of the packages. Where as `package.json` catalogs them. This Directory holds all of their content (similair to Poetry with Python)

> Question 1

The purpose of this program is purely entertainment. It has no bearing on the real world however it does bring in some complexity. At least the web version does. Requiring a web server, multiple packages, running an API, and even the hardest of all **styling it**. The inputs and outputs are fairly basic. In goes the users attempted solution, out returns where they failed. In the web version it displays all errors, where as the code.org version goes down the line and only one is produced. The page redirects as well could be counted I guess. When a user (in code.org version), succeeds or starts the game they must make an input to achieve that output, in this case clicking a button.

Initially the app was introduced as a joke. Make something someone already did and make it worse. We went with [neal.fun](https://neal.fun)'s Password Game that took the likes of the internet by storm for a few days. We found and were told that our UI had a bad UX. It was confusing and, to put it bluntly, a mess. Which was very true. Instead of claiming the good ol' ***Its a feature not a bug!1!!11!***. We made the UI more synchronic to the rest of the app and allowed for it to be (slightly) more understandable. Essentially we just cleaned up the rough edges as the product itself functioned as asked.
